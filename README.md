## Multi Omic Survival Analysis
### Introduction
For this project, we implement survival analysis algorithms for multi-omic cancer patient data from the TCGA dataset.
The data contains several genomic datasets for each of 8 types of cancers. Each dataset is an omic:
- MicroRNA expression 
- Gene expression
- DNA methylation
We implement a baseline algorithm by concatenating all datasets and learning a survival analysis predictor on it. Then we implement a multi-view learning algorithm that takes the different distributions in each omic into consideration when learning.
For task 3, we implement a transfer learning algorithm, for learning on multiple cancers and predicting on the data of just one.
